# SnapThat

## The game
SnapThat is a game in what players have to find objects in real life and photograph (snap) them.
Every 30-120 minutes, a new object becomes available in a present in the play-screen, you will be notified when this happens!
This present can be opened for a limited time (after this is becomes expired and cannot be opened anymore), and when a player does so, the user sees what object has to be photographed. The camera can be opened, and when returning from the camera, the image will be analyzed.
If the analysis was positive, you will see what your score was, and you succesfully snapped that thing!
On the social page, you can check your experience, your last score, and your SnapStreak (the average score of the last 10 games).
Keeping your SnapStreak low is difficult. You can share your SnapStreak over various social media to compare with friends and show them who's boss.
