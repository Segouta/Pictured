### Description

SnapThat is a game in what players have to find objects in real life and photograph (snap) them.
Every 30-120 minutes, a new object becomes available in a present in the play-screen.
Moreover, the user will receive a notification when this happens.
This present can be opened for a limited time, 25 minutes.
When the user opens the present, the user sees what object needs to be found.
The camera can be opened, and when returning from the camera, the image will be analyzed.
If the tags from the analysis contain the thing that needed to be found, the timer stops, and the time it took the user to accomplish this since the present was opened is saved as the score.
The user now can see how he is doing on the social page.
Not only are the amount of played games available, but also the score from last game, and the average score of the last 10 games.
This average is called the SnapStreak, and keeping this number low is difficult. You can share your SnapStreak over various social media to compare with friends.

In the user screen, users can logout, and in the settings screen, users can see some credits.
When a user loses internet connection, the app will redirect the user to the main activity, and disable options that require internet connection.
